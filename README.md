# Sample Hardhat Project

The video shows the project working within the hardhat testing suite. I put it here becasue it was over 4 minutes long due to delays with messaging between arbitrum goerli and polygon mumbai.

The link below goes to the github for the front end of the website:

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
